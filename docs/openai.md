Text generation and prompting
Learn how to prompt a model to generate text.
With the OpenAI API, you can use a large language model to generate text from a prompt, as you might using ChatGPT. Models can generate almost any kind of text responseâ€”like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Here's a simple example using the Responses API.

Generate text from a simple prompt
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});

console.log(response.output_text);
An array of content generated by the model is in the output property of the response. In this simple example, we have just one output which looks like this:

[
    {
        "id": "msg_67b73f697ba4819183a15cc17d011509",
        "type": "message",
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "output_text",
                "text": "Under the soft glow of the moon, Luna the unicorn danced through fields of twinkling stardust, leaving trails of dreams for every child asleep.",
                "annotations": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
